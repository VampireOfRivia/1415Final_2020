# 1415Final_2020
Code for final project - A text based adventure game!

LINES 40-179

My “main()” function was written as intro(). When I tried to change it to main at some point in the creation of this project, it ended up breaking my program. There is one screenshot below where it breaks, for some odd reason, and I cannot figure out how to move past this. 

LINES 181-210

Bad ending #1 – ends by drinking so much water, you go to the bathroom and die by venomous snake bite.

LINES 212-396

Just more introduction stuff, none of it is extremely noteworthy. However, you will have the option to split this story into what I call the “impatient path” or the “patient path”.

LINES 407 – 884 (impatient path)

Bad ending #2- ends by using your blade to kill the dragon 

Bad ending #3 – give spartan the white potion. He disappears. The princess disappears. Your heart rips from your chest as you transform into a hideously deformed dragon. You fall asleep as you wait for a true champion… 

Bad ending #4 – don’t give spartan the potion. You run away with the princess. You’re both alive but you have a “feeling” you could have done better.  

Bad ending #5 – give spartan the black potion. He disappears. The princess turns into a dragon and eats you.

LINES 895 – 1363, 1415-1448, 1475-1508 (patient path)

Bad ending #7 – ends by using your blade to kill the dragon... but the princess dies too.

Bad ending #8 – give spartan the white potion. both you and the princess die.

Bad ending #9 – don’t give spartan the white potion. you both escape. the princess leaves you for being selfish.

Bad ending #10 - dragon disappears. princess turns into a zombie and eats you.

Bad ending #11 – same as #9 EXCEPT slight dialogue change... and princess doesn't leave you.

LINES 1365-1413, 1450-1473, 1510-1634 (only accessible through patient path!)

Good ending – you give the dragon the rose instead of the princess potion. The dragon transforms into an angel. The angel vows to watch over you and aurora forever.

 
Optimal Path (True Ending):
-Enter name 

-3

-1

-1

-1

-3

-3 (program keeps breaking here????)

-1 (if my program worked, this would be starting the rest of the True Ending path.)

-1 or 2 (this choice would not have mattered. The first choice merely prints out the lines of the contents  of your bag.)

-5 (this would have been the final option and would have printed the “congrats.txt” file THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN if you picked the rose. Anything else would have given you bad ending #11.)
